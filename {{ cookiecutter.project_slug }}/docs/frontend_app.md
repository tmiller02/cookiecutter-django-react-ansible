# Frontend App

## Overview

The frontend app is built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). For learning React, refer to the [React documentation](https://react.dev/).

## Running the Development Server

If you have `npm` installed on your host machine, start the development server with:

```
cd frontend_app
npm run start
```

Access the app at http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically reload on edits, and lint errors will appear in the console.

## Formatting

To format code using [Prettier](https://prettier.io):

```
npm run prettier
```

## Creating a Production Build

A production-ready, optimized build is automatically generated by Ansible provisioning. To preview this build in the Podman dev environment:

```
./provision_dev_environment.sh
```

Then visit https://localhost:5000, where it is served by NGINX in the 'frontend' container.

## Production Deployment

The production build is served by NGINX, which redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS. Files in `build/static/` are served directly; other URLs fall back to `index.html` if no matching file is found.

NGINX also sets [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) headers for enhanced security, restricting content to the site's own origin. This configuration blocks external scripts and inline event handlers in CSP-supporting browsers.
