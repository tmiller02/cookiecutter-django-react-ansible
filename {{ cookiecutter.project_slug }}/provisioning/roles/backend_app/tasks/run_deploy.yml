# Deploy the project using the 'deploy_helper' ansible module. This copies the backend_app
# code into a unique release folder, with the 'current' symlink pointing to the latest
# release.
#
# These tasks are used when running a full deployment of the backend application
# (i.e. when deploying to a production server).
#
# This deploy strategy can be helpful if you need to quickly roll back to a previous
# release (by just changing the 'current' symlink to point to a different folder and
# restarting the systemd service). However, bear in mind that this approach may not be
# sufficient depending on what has changed between releases. For example, you may need
# to also consider changes made to the database by migrations.
#
# See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/deploy_helper_module.html#deploy-helper-module
# for more info.
