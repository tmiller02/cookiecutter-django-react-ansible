# Configuring PyCharm

## Setting up a Remote Python Interpreter

> Support for Vagrant Python interpreters is a feature of PyCharm Professional.
> If you don't see an option to add a Vagrant interpreter you may be using
> PyCharm Community Edition.

To ensure that many PyCharm features work correctly, we need to configure PyCharm to use
the Python interpreter from our Vagrant VM.

Go to `File → Settings → Project → Project Interpreter`. Click the gear icon and click 'Add'.

Select 'Vagrant' from the side panel. Change the 'Vagrant Instance Folder' to your
project's directory, select the 'dev' VM, and set the 'Python Interpreter Path' to
`/opt/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_backend/venv/bin/python`.

Click 'OK'. You should now see that the packages from the backend app's virtualenv are
listed.

Click 'OK' again. PyCharm will spend the next couple of minutes indexing:

Once it's finished indexing you should be ready to go.

## Running backend app tests from PyCharm

This project comes with several preconfigured PyCharm run configurations
