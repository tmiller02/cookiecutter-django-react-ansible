# Tasks to be run when the backend_app code is made available on the target machine
# via a vagrant mount from the host machine (i.e. when using a dev VM).
#
# The Vagrantfile has been configured to mount the 'current' folder on the target
# machine to the 'backend_app' folder on the host machine, so we don't need to do
# anything else to make any code changes available on the target machine (compare to
# the tasks in 'run_deploy.yml').
#
# We configure the 'venv' folder to be alongside (rather than within) the 'current'
# directory when running a Vagrant environment.
#
# It is desirable to have the virtualenv exist within the code directory with the
# deployment strategy used in 'run_deploy.yml', since rolling back by changing the
# 'current' symlink will roll back both the code and the virtualenv. However, running a
# virtualenv from within a vagrant mounted directory comes with a substantial
# performance impact, especially with the StatReloader as used by default when running
# django runserver.
#
# By locating the virtualenv directory alongside the 'current' directory we exclude its
# contents from the vagrant mount, thereby avoiding this performance impact.
